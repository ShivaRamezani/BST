# BST
implemented height calculation, inorder, preorder, postorder, and breadthfirst traversal of a BST.
Inorder, preorder, and post order implementations are without using recursion. Stacks are being used instead. 

Tree.java file has implementations of containAll, removeAll and other functions needed. 
DriverBST.java file is a test class to test the tree and bst files.
